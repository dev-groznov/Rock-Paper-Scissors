# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Using my knowledge, I wrote a game called "Rock, Paper, Scissors" that runs in the terminal:
1. As soon as you land on the page, you receive a notification asking you to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

2. After you make your choice, the round result is displayed in the console.

3. After 5 rounds, the game result is displayed in the console.

This is my first JavaScript project (from The Odin Project course). It gave me firsthand experience with how functions are implemented and how to solve problems.
